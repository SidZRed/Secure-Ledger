# Secure-Ledger

This is my implementation of a distributed secure ledger such as a blockchain from scratch.

It involves a blockchain class which has methods to add new transactions and blocks to the ledger. It then allows to create new blocks using an API call.
It also has an endpoint for mining the blockchain to recieve rewards and other endpoints for adding new transactions, registering nodes and a consensus algorithm to help keep track of the ledger.

This was implemented mainly using python and some of the API funcitonalities using Flask.
